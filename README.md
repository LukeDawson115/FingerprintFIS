This project explores the application of fuzzy logic to enhance fingerprint biometric security systems. 
We address the challenge of interpreting variable biometric data by integrating fuzzy logic, aiming to reduce false positives and negatives in authentication processes. 
The report includes a thorough literature review, detailed system design, technical implementation insights, and a comprehensive evaluation of the experimental results. 
My goal is to showcase the potential of fuzzy logic in improving the accuracy and reliability of biometric authentication systems.
